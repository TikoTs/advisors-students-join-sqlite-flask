The project shows many-to-many relationship using SQLite database and uses flask for show the list of advisors with number of students(I used Bootstrap for the table design). Then you can click on a button and see
who are the students of a particular advisor. 

At first, you have to run db.py to create tables. 
Then, run app.py where is the main logic written.
